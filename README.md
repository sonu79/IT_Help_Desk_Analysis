Project Report: IT Help Desk Analysis

Introduction:
The IT Help Desk Analysis project aims to delve into the ticketing data collected over the past 5 years to gain valuable insights into the IT help desk operations and user experiences. By analyzing various aspects of the ticketing system, we aim to identify trends, areas of improvement, and patterns in user behavior, allowing us to make data-driven decisions to enhance the IT support services.

Key Insights:

Growth in Ticket Volume:
The analysis reveals a consistent growth in the number of tickets raised by employees over the 5-year period. This escalating trend highlights the increasing demand for IT support and services within the organization.

Significant Demand for System Issues:
Approximately 75% of the total tickets raised fall under the category of system issues. This indicates a substantial demand for IT assistance in resolving system-related problems and highlights the critical role of IT in maintaining the organization's technological infrastructure.

Dominance of Normal Severity Tickets:
A staggering 91% of the tickets were classified as Normal Severity, implying that the majority of reported issues or requests are routine in nature. Understanding this distribution helps allocate resources effectively and efficiently, ensuring prompt handling of tickets.

High Priority Tickets:
36% of the tickets were assigned a high priority, indicating the existence of urgent and critical IT-related matters that require immediate attention and resolution. These high-priority tickets should be closely monitored to ensure timely and satisfactory resolution.

SLA Compliance Challenges:
Half of the total tickets did not meet the Service Level Agreement (SLA) time, suggesting a need to optimize response and resolution times to improve customer satisfaction and meet SLA targets. Analyzing the reasons behind SLA non-compliance can lead to enhanced service delivery.

Age-based Analysis:
The analysis of ticket resolution times and satisfaction rates across different age groups reveals interesting insights. Both the young age group (24-39) and the middle age group (40-49) have similar resolution times and satisfaction rates, indicating a consistent level of service quality across these age demographics.

Conclusion:
The IT Help Desk Analysis project sheds light on crucial aspects of the IT support services within the organization. The increasing ticket volume, particularly in system-related issues, emphasizes the growing importance of efficient IT support. The dominance of normal severity tickets allows for resource allocation optimization. However, the existence of high-priority tickets and SLA non-compliance highlights areas for improvement in response and resolution times. Age-based analysis provides insights into consistent service quality across different age groups.

By leveraging these key insights, the organization can implement targeted strategies to enhance the IT help desk's efficiency, improve SLA compliance, and ultimately elevate overall user satisfaction. Regular data-driven evaluations will ensure continuous improvement and a seamless IT support experience for all employees.
